# Beehive Management System

&nbsp;
## 00 Start the project
* In VS, create a Windows Forms Application project.

&nbsp;
## 01 Build the form
* Add a GroupBox, a ComboBox, a NumericUpDown, Labels, Buttons and a TextBox.

&nbsp;
## 02 Add the Worker class and its constructor
* The constructor just sets the jobsICanDo field, which is a string array. Itâ€™s private because we want the queen to ask the worker to do a job, rather than make her check whether he knows how to do it.
